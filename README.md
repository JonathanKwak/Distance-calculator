# Distance-calculator
A nice little side project to learn and utilize API's.

This project utilizes the OpenRouteService API.

It's a bit buggy when you put in the wrong negative or positive number, and when you input two locations that cannot be driven to (for example, Iceland and South Africa... you can't cross the water with a car, at least not yet)
